<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This repository contains a <code>.bashrc</code> configuration that adds audible feedback to your terminal. Whenever you run scripts, commands, or processes, you'll hear chimes or sounds that indicate success, failure, or completion. It's a great way to get instant, hands-free feedback while working in the terminal.

### Built With

.bashrc

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started, simply copy the provided <code>.bashrc</code> file to your home directory or append its contents to your existing <code>.bashrc</code>. This will enable audible feedback for your terminal sessions.

### Prerequisites

You will need:
* A Bash-compatible terminal (e.g., Git Bash, WSL, Linux, macOS Terminal)
* A system with audio playback capability

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy the <code>.bashrc</code> file to your home directory, or append its contents to your existing <code>.bashrc</code>:
  ```sh
  cat .bashrc >> ~/.bashrc
  ```
3. Restart your terminal or run <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> to apply the changes.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once installed, use your terminal as usual. When you run commands, scripts, or processes, you'll hear chimes or sounds indicating their status. You can customize the sounds or triggers by editing the <code>.bashrc</code> file.

_For more customization tips, see the comments in the <code>.bashrc</code> file._

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

1️⃣ Progress Sparkle / Interval Chimes

For really long-running commands (>1 min), play a subtle “sparkle” or coin sound every 30 seconds to show progress.

Example: [console]::beep(1500,40); [console]::beep(1600,40)

Gives a feeling like “you’re collecting coins while working.”

2️⃣ Command-specific melodies

Different tasks get unique chimes:

npm run build → classic Mario chime

npm test → short high-pitched “ding”

git pull → soft 2-note ascending tone

Makes it easy to know what finished without looking at the terminal.

3️⃣ Combo bonus for multiple successes

If multiple commands finish in sequence quickly, you could trigger a special “combo” melody, like stacking 3–4 Mario coins rapidly.

Encourages a playful sense of accomplishment when running batches.

4️⃣ Victory fanfare for consecutive successes

Keep a success streak counter in your Bash session.

After 3–5 consecutive successful commands, play a slightly longer or more elaborate “victory fanfare.”

5️⃣ Mini “fail feedback” melody variations

Make different failure tunes to indicate:

Minor failure → soft “oops”

Critical failure → longer descending sad tone

Can be mapped to exit codes if some commands return different error numbers.

6️⃣ Optional ambient chime for long-running processes

While a command is running >1 min, a subtle repeating sparkle or short 1–2 note pattern every 15–30 seconds keeps it interactive.

Gives you a “live progress soundscape” without needing visual monitoring.

7️⃣ Gamify with your terminal session

Track metrics like:

Total commands completed today

Longest successful streak

Play a special fanfare when hitting milestones (like “you completed 10 builds!”)

8️⃣ Custom user-defined melodies

Let the user define their own chime sequences in an array or config file.

Could include classic game sounds, short scales, or soft bells — anything [console]::beep can handle.

create a “full-featured gamified notifyme” version that:

Has progress chimes for long-running commands

Keeps success/failure variations

Plays stacked melodies / grand fanfare for long commands

Can even track streaks and milestones

Turn your terminal into a mini Mario reward system.
